<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Update on the migration to npm (dropping Bower support)" %}
{% capture text %}
During January we announced our plan to [decommission the FT Bower Registry and migrate to the public npm registry](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2021/01/18/deprecating-bower-and-origami-via-npm/#who-does-this-affect).

Work has now started on migrating the Origami components onto npm, 8 out of 66 of our component are now migrated, ready to be released. We aim to have all components, including documentation/guidance for how to migrate your products, complete by the start of Q3.

As a reminder, below is a copy of our planned timeline to decommission the FT Bower Registry.

1st July 2021 - Origami Components moved from Bower to npm and guides to migrate are written

1st July 2021 - Deprecate the FT Bower Registry

1st July 2022 - Decommission the FT Bower Registry

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New “Introduction to Origami” dates" %}
{% capture text %}
 
Please join us on 26th April for updated Introduction to Origami sessions! ✨ 

Part 1 is useful for anyone who works in Product and Technology – we cover things at a high level rather than diving into too many technical details, including:

- Origami History
- Origami Components
- Origami Services
- Origami Collaboration

Part 2 will explore components in more depth, including some technical details. It will be of particular interest to engineers and designers, although anyone is welcome:

- Documentation
- Languages & Tools
- Structure
- Versioning
- Origami Build Service / Manual Build
- Practical Tutorial (optional)

We'll be running these on the 26th April, at a time suitable for London and Sofia. We'll share a recording for those who can't make it, but it would be great to see you there! Please let us know if you or someone on your team would like an invite.

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Guidance on how to customise an Origami component" %}
{% capture text %}
We now have a page to help Origami users decide if they need to customise an Origami component, and if so, how to go about it in a safe, supported way to avoid the customisation breaking in the future.

Please [have a read through the page](https://origami.ft.com/docs/components/customisation/) and let us know of any feedback you may have or suggestions for other topics we could write guidance for.

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special Thanks" %}

{% capture text %}
We recently had an uptick in the amount of security researchers wanting to submit reports about potential issues on [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io). We'd like to thank the Cyber Security team for communicating with the security researchers and reviewing their reports for us.
