<!-- Preamble (just for the first newsletter) -->
{% capture text %}

	Welcome to the first issue of the Origami Newsletter!
	We'll be sending out an email like this at the end of each month,
	keeping all the people who use Origami up-to-date with what we're working on.

<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %}

	This issue covers a new major version of o-layout,
	the release of the Polyfill Service v3,
	and an overview of the Origami roadmap for 2019.

<!-- Top 3 things -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Top three things" %}

{% capture text %}

	These are some of the bigger things we've worked on or released over the last month.

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New major of o-layout" %}
{% capture text %}

	The v3.0.0 release of o-layout adds two new layout options:
	landing page and query page. These should reduce the amount
	of time that teams spend overriding styles. The aim of o-layout
	is to provide a one-stop-shop for the visual presentation of
	internal services and documentation.

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New major of the Polyfill Service" %}

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special thanks" %}

{% capture text %}

	This monthâ€™s special thanks goes to Chee Rabbits, who has been
	helping the team to make Origami components available on npm.
	Theyâ€™ve been a lot of fun to work with, and have persevered time
	and time again with some very complicated technical problems.
	Thanks Chee ðŸ˜Š
