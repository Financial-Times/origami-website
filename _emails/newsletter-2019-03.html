<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %}

    This issue features the new Origami website with a new design and new documentation; a highlight of the improved service that the Polyfill Service provides, and an explanation of how ECMAScript Modules broke our components.

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Origami Website Launch" %}
{% capture text %}

    This month we've successfully launched the <a href="https://origami.ft.com/" target="_blank">new Origami website</a>. It is officially out of beta, and implements all of the new features of o-layout, which has unified the design across our documentation and our registry. In addition to the visual changes, this launch is packed full of new documentation and a more digestible spec. You can find more detailed information about the launch in <a href="https://origami.ft.com/blog/2019/03/11/site-update">this blog post</a>. As always, we welcome any feedback or questions you might have about the new website's content and UI.

{% capture text %}

    Three years ago, the <a href="https://polyfill.io" target="_blank">Polyfill Service</a> served 400 million polyfills per month. Today, it serves <strong>800 million</strong> <em>every day</em> ðŸ’ª.
