Welcome to the first issue of the Origami Newsletter! We'll be publishing a post like this at the end of each month, keeping all the people who use Origami up-to-date with what we're working on.

**TL;DR:** This issue covers a new major version of o-layout, a new component named o-stepped-progress, and the release of the Polyfill Service v3.


## Top three things

### New major of o-layout

The v3.0.0 release of o-layout adds two new layout options: landing page and query page. These should reduce the amount of time that teams spend overriding styles. The aim of o-layout is to provide a one-stop-shop for the visual presentation of internal services and documentation. [Find more information on our blog post about this release](#TODO).

## Special thanks

This monthâ€™s special thanks goes to Chee Rabbits, who has been helping the team to make Origami components available on npm. Theyâ€™ve been a lot of fun to work with, and have persevered time and time again with some very complicated technical problems. Thanks Chee ðŸ˜Š
