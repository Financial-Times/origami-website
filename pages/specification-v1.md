The Origami specification outlines the requirements for Origami-compatible components and services. This is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/"  >normative</a> specification; non-normative (informative) sections are indicated explicitly or by inset and boxed asides. The words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** have the meaning given to them in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"  >RFC 2119</a>.

<aside>
	This section of the site is meant for people who are building Origami components or services. To use Origami, see the <a href="/docs/components/">components documentation</a> and <a href="/docs/services/">services documentation</a>.

## Overview

_This section is non-normative._

Conforming to the Origami specification when building components or services is beneficial for a number of reasons:

  - Your code will be easier for other teams who use Origami to understand
  - Switching support of your code over to the Origami team will be smoother
  - Your component or service will be discoverable, appearing in the [Origami Registry](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components)


## Next steps

We've split these documents into a formal specification as well as a condensed specification. We recommend that new users read the condensed spec when starting to build things for Origami, as this gets you set up more quickly. The formal spec is meant as a comprehensive reference and should answer any additional questions you have.

  - Read the [condensed specification](/spec/v1/condensed/)
  - Read the [formal specification](/spec/v1/formal/)
