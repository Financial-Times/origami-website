Origami is designed to serve users from a number of different backgrounds, working with a variety of different projects.
As all people come with different experiences and types of understanding, we try to consider all of our communication very carefully.

To strike a balance between a professional and friendly tone, while being clear and helpful, our writing follows a few essential writing styles and uses of language.

## General Styles

Origami has a [normative specification](/spec) for _building_ a component, which follows more formal conventions. But we also maintain a lot of documentation on how to _use_ our components and services, and for these, we aim for a more casual tone.

##### Be conversational
- Use contractions: "we're" over "we are"
- Starting sentences with conjunctions like "but" or "so" is allowed.

As we've said, we aim to be conversational. We speak with contractions and begin our sentences with conjunctions, so we would like to translate that to our writing, as wellâ€”if it sounds like something we'd say out loud, we're likely on the right track.

##### Prefer "we" to "I"
- **good**: "We would recommend you do ..."
- **bad**: "I would recommend you do ..."

The work we do is as a team, and we rely on each other, and the input from our users, to be able to maintain and deliver our work. It is an inclusive language that can extend to the reader, and discourages the use of the passive voice.

##### Use the active voice
- **good**: "We would recommend you do ..."
- **bad**: "It is recommended you do ..."

The active voice provides clarity, context and responsibility. If we are passive in our writing, we become vague and we distance ourselves from what we are trying to convey. This isn't helpful to our users, who rely on and trust our ability to take responsibility for the work we do.

##### Prefer shorter sentences

Shorter sentences are easier for readers to take in.
If we find we've ended up with too many commas or a long running sentence, odds are we can break it down into more readable chunks.

##### Omit fluff and filler words

By that, we mean qualifiers. Qualifiers are words like "pretty", "mostly", "probably", "usually". They can make the information in our writing ambiguous. They can also communicate  an opinion about something. Though we want to be conversational, we don't want to start documenting unhelpful statements.

##### Write for skim readers
- code variables go in `back-ticks`
- use tables
- use asides
- use lists
- highlight copy where appropriate
- use informative, short, headings.

By providing any of the above, we'll allow skim readers to quickly scan our documentation to find relevant information, quickly. It also helps us break different topics down into digestible sections.

##### Avoid metaphors or colloquialisms
- **good**: "this site has everything you need to know"
- **bad**: "This site is a one stop shop for Origami"

We work with many different nationalities and levels of command of the English language. We need to keep in mind that there is phrasing that non-native English speakers may not be familiar with.

## Origami-specific styles

##### Always capitalise Origami when referring to the product

In house, most people are familiar with the Origami team. But outside of the company, origami is something entirely different, and it is important that we make that distinction.

##### Never capitalise component names

- **good**: o-table, o-message
- **bad**: O-table, O-Table, o-Table

Our components are named in lower case and are available to use from package managers in the same way.
We use capitalisation within components for purposes other than their description.

##### Always capitalise service names

- **good**: the Polyfill Service, the Build Service
- **bad**: the polyfill service, the build service

Similarly to the capitalising "Origami", we capitalise the services we maintain because they are distinguished products that have user-facing interfaces of their own.
